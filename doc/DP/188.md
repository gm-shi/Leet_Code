# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

```
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

**Solution:**

### 1. DP

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][2 * k];
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * k; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                dp[0][i] = -prices[0];
            }
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 2 * k; j++) {
                if (j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], 0 - prices[i]);
                } else if (j % 2 == 1) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + prices[i]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] - prices[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[prices.length - 1][2 * k - 1];
    }
}
```
