# 63. Unique Paths II

```
You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

**Solution:**

### 1. DP

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length, n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        if (obstacleGrid[m - 1][n - 1] == 1 || obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1) // 如果在起点或终点出现了障碍，直接返回0
            return 0;
        int dp[][] = new int[m][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < m && obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n && obstacleGrid[0][i] == 0; i++) {
            dp[0][i] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {

                dp[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1 ? 0 : dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];

    }
}
```
