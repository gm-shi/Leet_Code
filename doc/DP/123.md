# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

```
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

**Solution:**

### 1. DP

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][4];
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0]; //first time have stock
        dp[0][1] = 0;          // first time sold
        dp[0][2] = -prices[0]; //second time have stock
        dp[0][3] = 0;           // second time sold

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], 0 - prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);
            dp[i][2] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][2], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][3] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][3], dp[i - 1][2] + prices[i]);
        }
        return dp[prices.length - 1][3];
    }
}
```
