# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

```
Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Â 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.



```

**Solution:**

### 1. Greedy

```java

import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> {
            return a[0] - b[0];
        });
        int count = 0;
        int cur = intervals[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < cur) {
                count++;
                cur = Math.min(cur, intervals[i][1]);
            }
            else cur = intervals[i][1];
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```
