# 968. Binary Tree Cameras

```
You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

Â 

Example 1:


Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
Example 2:


Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

**Solution:**

### 1. Greedy

```java


class Solution {

    private class TreeNode {
        int val;
        TreeNode left;
        TreeNode right;

        TreeNode() {
        }

        TreeNode(int val) {
            this.val = val;
        }

        TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
            this.val = val;
            this.left = left;
            this.right = right;
        }
    }

    int result;

    public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
        result = 0;
        if (traversal(root) == 0)
            result++;
        return result;
    }

    private int traversal(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null)
            return 2;
        int left = traversal(node.left);
        int right = traversal(node.right);
        if (left == 2 && right == 2)
            return 0;
        if (left == 0 || right == 0) {
            result++;
            return 1;
        }
        ;
        return 2;
    }
}

```
