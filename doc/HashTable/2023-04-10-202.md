Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not

![Example](/Leetcode/assets/202.png)

**Solution:**

### 1. HashSet

- use set to record the sum of each number if the set contains the sum then return false else if it equals to 1 then return true.

```java

class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {

        Set<Integer> set  = new HashSet();
       while(!set.contains(n)) {
            set.add(n);
            if(n == 1) return true;

            int sum = 0;
            while(n != 0 ) {
            int num = n % 10;
            sum += num * num;
            n = n/10;
            }
            n = sum;

       }
       return false;
    }
}

```
