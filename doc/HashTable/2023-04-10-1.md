title: "1. Two Sum"
---

---

Given an array of integers numsÂ and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Solution:**

### 1. Hash Map

- use map to record the number as key in the arr and its index as value
- find the key of `target - current` number, if true return these two numbers

```java

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap();
        int[] ans = new int[2];
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            int tmp = target - nums[i];
            if(map.containsKey(tmp)) {
                ans[0] = i;
                ans[1] = map.get(tmp);
                break;
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```
